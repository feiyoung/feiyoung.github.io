### About

I am a postdoctoral fellow mentored by [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/) and [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/).
I received the [NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) ([1K99HG011468-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10104023)) from [NIH/NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in March 2021, with the mentorship from [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/), and [Dr. Andrew Feinberg](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/andrew-feinberg-1), to develop computational methods for inferring single-cell DNA methylation and its spatial landscape.
Before that I was jointly mentored by [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and [Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti](https://aravindachakravartilab.org/) on gene regulatory network inference. My research interests mainly focus on mathematical modelling of gene regulation, develop computational and statistical methods for tackling the challenges in the intersection of statistics, single-cell genomics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics, and ultimately understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. The outcomes are expected to lead to the development of new targeted therapy and new therapeutic medicine for various diseases that help the broad community.

I obtained my B.S. in [Computational Mathematics](http://math.sysu.edu.cn/) with the Academic Award for Excellent Students and the [Xu Chongqing
Award](http://edf.edaao.sysu.edu.cn/jzmx/jz03/cgzs02/index.htm) for academic excellence from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) (2009-2013).
I received my PhD in [Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php) with [University Postgraduate Fellowships (UPF)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) and [Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Wai-Ki Ching](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/) (2013-2017).
