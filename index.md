### About

I am a postdoctoral fellow mentored by [Prof. Jin Liu](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/jinliu/) at the [Center for Quantitative  Medicine](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/cqm), [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/).
I received the [NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) ([1K99HG011468-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10104023)) from [NIH/NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in March 2021, with the mentorship from [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/), and [Dr. Andrew Feinberg](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/andrew-feinberg-1), to develop computational methods for inferring single-cell DNA methylation and its spatial landscape.
Before that I was jointly mentored by [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and [Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti](https://aravindachakravartilab.org/) on gene regulatory network inference. My research interests mainly focus on mathematical modelling of gene regulation, develop computational and statistical methods for tackling the challenges in the intersection of statistics, single-cell genomics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics, and ultimately understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. The outcomes are expected to lead to the development of new targeted therapy and new therapeutic medicine for various diseases that help the broad community.

I obtained my B.S. in [Mathmatics](http://math.swu.edu.cn/) with outstanding graduate from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.swu.edu.cn/), [Southwest University](http://www.swu.edu.cn/) (2011-2015).

I received my PhD in [Statistics](https://csr.swufe.edu.cn/) with University Postgraduate Fellowships (UPF) and [Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS)] from [Center of Statistic Research](https://csr.swufe.edu.cn/) and [School of Statistics](https://stat.swufe.edu.cn/), [Southwest university of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Huazhen Lin](https://csr.swufe.edu.cn/) (2015-2020).
