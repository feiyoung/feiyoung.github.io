8/2019-present & {\bf Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University}, Baltimore\\
& Mentor: Dr. Stephanie Hicks, Dr. Hongkai Ji\\
& Focus on developing statistical and computational methods to tackle the challenges in single-cell genomics and epigenomics using multi-omics data, such as scRNA-seq data imputation benchmark, scATAC-seq signal enhancement, differential pseudotime analysis, inferring DNA methylation and its spatial landscape, and multiple collaborative research on investigating glioblastoma, pediatric glioma, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and PD-1 therapy\\
 8/2017-8/2019 & {\bf Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University}, Baltimore\\
& Mentor:  Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti, Dr. Suchi Saria \\
& Focus on developing statistical models for analyzing time-series genomic data in cell reprogramming, the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, and characterizing the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression\\
