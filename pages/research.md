### Research Interests

My graduate research focuses on Statistical Theory and Methods involving latent factor models and related techniques:
 
- Nonlinear dimension reduction 
 
- Estimation and inference in regression models with missing covariates

- Statistical testing in high-dimensional models


Now, I am passionate about Statistical Genomics to
develop computational and statistical methods by latent factor models and spatial-related techniques:

- Dimension reduction and clustering for Single cell RNA sequencing data

- Spatial dimension reduction and  clustering for spatially resolved transcriptomics data 

- Integration analysis for  spatially resolved transcriptomics data
