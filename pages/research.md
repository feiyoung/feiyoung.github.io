### Research Interests

My graduate research focus on the controllability of Boolean network, a theoretical model for Gene Regulatory Networks, has significantly enhanced my understanding of genomics. My contributions to machine learning have led to new methods for disease diagnosis and prognoses. 
My postdoctoral research (2017-2019), under the joint mentorship of Drs. Chakravarti and Saria,
represented a first shift in focus from theoretical to computational genomics.
My current postdoctoral research (2019-now) with Drs. Ji and Hicks has provided complementary expertise in statistics, single-cell genomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics.


I am passionate about a variety of problems related to gene regulation, including genomics and epigenomics. I am focusing on 
developing computational and statistical methods for interpreting high-throughput data of multi modalities, especially single-cell data.
