[DR.SC](https://github.com/feiyoung/DR.SC): This is an R package for Joint dimension reduction and spatial clustering is conducted for Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data. It is not only computationally efficient and scalable to the sample size increment, but also is capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters as well. Please see the following paper for details:

[ILSE](https://github.com/feiyoung/ILSE): This is an R package for Iterative Least Square Estimation or Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation and inference for Linear Regression when data include missing values. Please see the following paper for details:

[Huazhen Lin\*, Wei Liu, & Wei Lan (2021). Regression Analysis with individual-specific patterns of missing covariates. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 39(1), 179-188.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2019.1635486)


[GFM](https://github.com/feiyoung/GFM): This is an R package for ultrahigh-dimension reduction and nonlinear feature extractionis via a Generalized factor model that can handle ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types. Moreover, [GFM MATLAB toolbox](https://github.com/feiyoung/MGFM) is also provided and runs faster in MATLAB environment. Please see the following paper for details:

[nptvcmPD](https://github.com/feiyoung/nptvcmPD): This  is an R package simplified from NonParametric Time-Varying Coefficient Model for Panel Data (nptvcmPD). Nonparametric time-varying coefficients model based penalty for longitudinal data with pre-specified finite time points, also known as panel data. Please see the following paper for details:
