[GFM](https://github.com/feiyoung/GFM): This is an R package for ultrahigh-dimension reduction and nonlinear feature extractionis via a Generalized factor model that can handle ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types. Moreover, [GFM MATLAB toolbox](https://github.com/feiyoung/MGFM) is also provided and runs faster in MATLAB environment.

[nptvcmPD](https://github.com/feiyoung/nptvcmPD): This  is an R package simplified from NonParametric Time-Varying Coefficient Model for Panel Data (nptvcmPD). Nonparametric time-varying coefficients model based penalty for longitudinal data with pre-specified finite time points, also known as panel data.
