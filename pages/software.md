- [TOSI](https://github.com/feiyoung/TOSI): TOSI is a package that provides a general framework of two directional simultaneous inference (TOSI) for high-dimensional as well as the fixed dimensional models with manifest variable or latent variable structure, such as high-dimensional mean models, high-dimensional sparse regression models, and high-dimensional latent factor models. Please see the following paper for details: [**Wei Liu**, Huazhen Lin\*, Jin Liu & Shurong Zheng (2023) Two-directional simultaneous inference for high-dimensional models, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, (Online)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2023.2191672).

- [iSC.MEB](https://xiaozhangryy.github.io/iSC.MEB/index.html): iSC.MEB is a package for integrating and analyzing multiple spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) datasets, which permits the users to simultaneously estimate the batch effect and perform spatial clustering for low-dimensional representations of multiple SRT datasets. Please see the following paper and pakage website for details: [Xiao Zhang, **Wei Liu**, Fangda Song, Jin Liu, iSC.MEB: an R package for multi-sample spatial clustering analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, Bioinformatics Advances, 2023;, vbad019](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbad019) and [iSC.MEB's usage and applications](https://xiaozhangryy.github.io/iSC.MEB/index.html).

- [PRECAST](https://github.com/feiyoung/PRECAST): PRECAST is a package for integrating and analyzing multiple spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) datasets and unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, requiring only partially shared cell/domain clusters across datasets. Please see the following paper and pakage website for details: 
[**Wei Liu**, Liao, X., Luo, Z. et al. Probabilistic embedding, clustering, and alignment for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with PRECAST. Nature Communications, 14, 296 (2023).](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35947-w) and [PRECAST's usage and applications](https://feiyoung.github.io/PRECAST/index.html).


- [DR.SC](https://github.com/feiyoung/DR.SC): This is an R package for Joint dimension reduction and spatial clustering is conducted for Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data. It is not only computationally efficient and scalable to the sample size increment, but also is capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters as well. Please see the following paper and pakage website  for details: 
[**Wei Liu**, Xu Liao, Yi Yang, Huazhen Lin, Joe Yeong, Xiang Zhou\*, Xingjie Shi\* & Jin Liu\* (2022). Joint dimension reduction and clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, Nucleic Acids Research, gkac219.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac219) and [DR.SC's usage and applications](https://feiyoung.github.io/DR.SC/index.html).

- [GFM](https://github.com/feiyoung/GFM): This is an R package for ultrahigh-dimension reduction and nonlinear feature extractionis via a Generalized factor model that can handle ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types. Moreover, [GFM MATLAB toolbox](https://github.com/feiyoung/MGFM) is also provided and runs faster in MATLAB environment. Please see the following paper and pakage website for details:
[**Wei Liu**, Huazhen Lin\*, Shurong Zheng & Jin Liu (2022). Generalized Factor Model for Ultra-High Dimensional Correlated Variables with Mixed Types. Journal of the American Statistics Association (Online).](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1999818) and [GFM's usage and applications](https://feiyoung.github.io/GFM/docs/index.html).

- [ILSE](https://github.com/feiyoung/ILSE): This is an R package for Iterative Least Square Estimation or Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation and inference for Linear Regression when data include missing values. Please see the following paper and pakage website for details:
[Huazhen Lin\*, **Wei Liu**, & Wei Lan (2021). Regression Analysis with individual-specific patterns of missing covariates. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 39(1), 179-188.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2019.1635486) and [ILSE's usage and applications](https://feiyoung.github.io/ILSE/index.html).




- [nptvcmPD](https://github.com/feiyoung/nptvcmPD): This  is an R package simplified from NonParametric Time-Varying Coefficient Model for Panel Data (nptvcmPD). Nonparametric time-varying coefficients model based penalty for longitudinal data with pre-specified finite time points, also known as panel data. Please see the following paper for details:
